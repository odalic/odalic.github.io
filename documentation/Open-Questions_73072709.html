From my (albeit shallow) understanding, AngularJS 2 is a different beast and it would mean to scrap a lot of the UI code and basically learn everything from start. Then we could almost go with ReactJS (which ought to be simpler for views) + some solution for controllers.

AFAIK, it is written in typescript which we do not use, has a different model of events similar to ReactJS, so a lot of time would be spent on re-learning things.
