As a result, there may be more than one entity correctly disambiguating the given cell value and user may need to classify the column with more than one class. Also relation may be annotated with different URIs - winning relations in each knowledge base. </p><p>Odalic Core produces for each knowledge base it is executed against a different set of scores, which are in general not comparable. So when recommending the classes/entities/relations to the user , it should always recommend classes/entities/relations which have highest score in each knowledge base. So if there are two different winning disambiguating entities in knowledge bases A and B, both should appear in the annotations. It should by default <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="291c6145-ec3c-4d75-b04d-6ac62bd63e41">recommend only the first object with the highest score from each knowledge base</span>. </p><p>There is a concept of primary knowledge base. When Odalic is being executed against more than one knowledge bases, user must decide which knowledge base is the primary one. Such knowledge base is used during export. User may further specify what should happen in case there is class/entity/relation in non-primary knowledge base, but it is missing in the primary knowledge base - either class/entity/relation from non-primary knowledge base is taken (its URI), or, new class/entity/relation must be created (generated or manually created) in the primary knowledge base and linked to non-primary resources. <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Currently (for iteration 2), if the class/entity/relation is missing in primary knowledge base, but is available in other knowledge bases, the resource from non-primary knowledge base should be used during export. </span></p><p>By default, only <strong>one</strong> winning annotation for class, entity, relation is taken from <strong>one</strong> knowledge base (as a result of the algorithm). Nevertheless, user may add more classes as annotations of the same column from the same knowledge base. In that moment, all such annotations are considered in UI and export. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="986dccf7-2973-4c8b-8d12-f062dc6bce6c">User is not allowed to select two different entities disambiguating the same object from the same knowledge base (as this typically does not make much sense).
