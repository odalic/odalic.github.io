                    <p>The server has to deal in some places with the need to create, manipulate, import, export, query or otherwise interact with RDF data. There are already several established libraries or even frameworks that provide these services directly or became a part of other libraries, which in turn have become the Odalic dependencies. The most prominent ones are:</p><ul><li><a href="http://rdf4j.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">RDF4J</a><ul><li>While there are some dependencies (such as the Pinto library used to annotate classes for export and import, which did not move to new version from the 2.7 yet) that require to use its older versions simultaneously to the recent ones, there is certainly deficit in the fact the explicit usage (in the algorithm relatively old version or export preprocessing, fairly recent one) could be reduced to one version, thus benefiting from the reduced size of the deployed archive, faster start-up and easier future maintenance.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://jena.apache.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jena</a><ul><li>While it may seem that many of the use cases are covered by RDF4J, Jena still found its use thanks to its capabilities in constructing of the SPARQL queries and potentially useful OWL support.</li></ul></li></ul>
